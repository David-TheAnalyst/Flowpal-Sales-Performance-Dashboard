### Introduction:

In today's fast-paced business landscape, companies are often awash in data, yet paradoxically, they can starve for actionable intelligence. The true challenge isn't collecting sales figures; it's transforming those raw transactions into a transparent, living blueprint that reveals *why* sales are surging, *where* opportunities are being missed, and *how* to proactively pivot for sustained growth. 

This project addresses precisely that critical gap for Flowpal – turning years of complex sales data into a crystal-clear, interactive narrative designed to illuminate hidden patterns and empower strategic decision-making. 

My objective was to move beyond historical reporting, delivering not just what happened, but actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and regional dynamics to propel Flowpal towards its annual objectives.

### Key Metrics at a Glance (Jan 2003 – May 2005):

* **Total Sales Generated:** $10.03 Million
* **Total Quantity Ordered:** 99,000 Units
* **Average Sales Value (per transaction):** $3.55 Thousand
* **Market Reach:** Sales across 4 Territories, 19 Countries, and 73 Cities
* **Customer Base:** 92 Distinct Customers

### Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

The following Power Bi feature were incorporated
* **Data Gathering**

### **Analysis:**

* A consistent trend of **highest sales in Q4** was identified, indicating strong seasonal demand. However, a deeper dive into **November 2004's record $1.09 Million revenue** revealed specific drivers: high demand for **Classic Cars, Vintage Cars, and Motorcycles**, prevalence of **Medium deal sizes**, and peak order days on **Wednesdays and Mondays**, with strong contributions from the **USA, Australia, and Sweden**.
  Conversely, the **sudden sales decline in December 2004** was meticulously traced to a significant drop in transactions from key markets (USA, UK, Sweden, contrasting with Spain's stability) and an overall reduction in closed deals, signaling a critical area for proactive intervention.

* Classic Cars emerged as the undisputed flagship, contributing $3.92 Million in sales from 34K units. This dominance highlights its market appeal. In stark contrast, the Train product's mere $226K in sales and 2,712 units revealed it as a significant drag on overall performance, necessitating a targeted improvement strategy.

* Analysis of customer behavior clearly identified the **Euro Shopping Channel** as a pivotal sales driver, alongside specific loyal customers like Mini Gift Distributors Ltd and Australian Collectors Co., indicating key relationships to nurture.

* The **USA** was confirmed as the largest market, complemented by strong performances from Spain, UK, Sweden, and Switzerland, underscoring concentrated areas for strategic expansion.

* A crucial insight across all dimensions was the **disproportionate revenue contribution from Medium-sized deals**, highlighting an optimization opportunity for sales and marketing efforts.


### **Recommendation:**

Based on these insights, It is ideal for the stakeholders to:

* Prioritize Classic Cars and conduct a deep dive into the Train product, applying Classic Car success patterns.
* Strengthen Euro Shopping partnership and intensify efforts in top-performing countries (USA, Spain, UK, Sweden, Switzerland).
* Develop targeted campaigns for high-contributing Medium-sized deals.
* Implement a process to investigate sudden sales drops (e.g., Dec 2004) and develop agile prevention strategies.
